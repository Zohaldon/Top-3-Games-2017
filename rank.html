            <p>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is an action-adventure game developed and published by Nintendo. A part of The Legend of Zelda series, it was released for the Nintendo Switch and Wii U consoles on March 3, 2017. The story follows Link, who awakens from a hundred-year slumber to a mysterious voice that guides him to defeat Calamity Ganon before he can destroy the kingdom of Hyrule.</p>
            <p>Breath of the Wild is played in an open world that the player can explore freely. Link can collect items such as armor, weapons, and food, with multiple uses. Scattered across the world are waypoints that the player can warp to, puzzles, and non-player characters that offer advice or side-quests. Breath of the Wild introduced elements to the series including a detailed physics engine, high-definition visuals, and voice acting. The game was planned for release in 2015 as a Wii U exclusive, but was delayed twice due to problems with the physics engine. It was a launch game for the Switch and the final Nintendo game for the Wii U.</p>
            <p>Breath of the Wild receiv
                ed critical acclaim for its open-ended gameplay, which encourages experimentation and exploration, and many called it a landmark in open-world design, despite minor criticism for its frame rate and technical performance at launch. It won numerous awards, including several Game of the Year awards, and many critics have described it as one of the greatest games of all time. The game broke Nintendo's sales records in numerous regions, selling over six million copies on the Switch and over a million on the Wii U by 2018.</p>
            <p>Yes, I know, it's almost too predictable at this point. Breath of the Wild is everyone's darling this year, but it's everyone's darling for a reason. It's just that good, that innovative, that different and new, changing everything we knew not only about Zelda, but about open-world games</p>
            <p>The game was also the Switch's big launch title, and certainly helped propel that system into the success it's become. And with good reason. I played Breath of the Wild with my jaw dropped almost the entire time, from the first time I realized I could just chop down a tree with that ax I just picked up, to the final boss fight. It's just a tremendous achievement in game design that will be one of this generation's most important games.</p>
