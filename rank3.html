            <h1 id="gname3">Super Mario Odyssey</h1>  
                         
            <p>Super Mario Odyssey is a 3D platform game developed and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo Switch. An installment in the Super Mario series, the story follows Mario and Cappy, a spirit that possesses Mario's hat and allows him to take control of other characters and objects as they set out on a journey across various worlds to save Princess Peach from his nemesis Bowser, who plans to forcibly marry her. In contrast to the linear gameplay of prior entries, the game returns to the primarily open-ended, exploration-based gameplay featured in Super Mario 64 and Super Mario Sunshine.</p>
            <p>Development began after the completion of Super Mario 3D World in 2013. Various ideas were suggested during development, and to incorporate them all, the team decided to employ a sandbox-style of gameplay. Unlike previous installments such as New Super Mario Bros. and Super Mario 3D World, which were aimed at a casual audience, the team designed Super Mario Odyssey to appeal to the series' core fans. The game also features a vocal theme song, "Jump Up, Super Star!", a first for the series.</p>
            <p>Super Mario Odyssey was released worldwide on October 27, 2017. It received acclaim from critics, with many calling it one of the best games in the series. The game won numerous awards, including Game of the Year from certain publications. By the end of 2017, it had sold over nine million copies worldwide, making it the system's bestseller.</p>
            <p>I loved almost every minute of Super Mario Odyssey. Few games in 2017 packed so much creativity into so little space. Around every corner is a new puzzle, a new area to explore, a new challenge, a new hidden secret. Odyssey is easily one of the best Mario games ever made, and even though I know that's a bold statement I can't help but make it. It's really just that good. If it was the only game on the Nintendo Switch, I'd still say go buy Nintendo's new system.</p>
