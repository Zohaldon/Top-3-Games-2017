            <h1>Overview</h1>
            <p>video games have been a splendid spot in a depressing year</p>
            <p>Right on time in 2017, we got the Switch, which made everything the all the more simple to take our side interest wherever we'd like. With the assistance of some noise wiping out earphones, the transport or the tram or the plane or the whole world would now be able to vanish. Thwomp.</p>
            <p>Who couldn't utilize that escape? Fantastical universes in crumple absolutely feel more reasonable than our own, where there appear to be few saints and unlimited evils.</p>
            <p>Year 2017 was a vintage year for diversions. We saw the dispatch of the Xbox One X and Nintendo Switch, the arrival of some astounding new titles like Horizon: Zero Dawn, and the rehash of long-term top choices like Assassin's Creed Origins and Zelda: Breath of the Wild. So narrowing this rundown down to 25 recreations was a genuine battle, and requesting them required watchful joint effort from the entire GR group. So how could we do it?</p>
            <p>2017 was an incredible year to be a gamer. Nintendo's spunky new Switch comfort ended up being a hit with a super solid first-year lineup, exemplary establishments like Zelda and Resident Evil got seemingly their best cycles ever, and we were overwhelmed by some shockingly great newcomers like Horizon Zero Dawn. New Atlas goes through our best recreations of 2017</p>
            <p>In the wake of playing through endless hours of computer games, I have figured out how to make a finish of-year list highlighting amusements from over all kinds. Obviously, there must be one number one, and a commendable (obvious) champ has turned out best.</p>
