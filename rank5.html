            <h1 id="gname5">Assassin Creed Origins</h1>
            
            <p>Assassin's Creed Origins is an action-adventure video game developed by Ubisoft Montreal and published by Ubisoft. It is the tenth major installment in the Assassin's Creed series and the successor to 2015's Assassin's Creed Syndicate. It was released worldwide for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on October 27, 2017.</p>
            <p>The game is set in Egypt near the end of the Ptolemaic period (49–47 BC) and recounts the secret fictional history of real-world events. The story explores the origins of the centuries-long conflict between the Brotherhood of Assassins, who fight for peace by promoting liberty, and The Order of the Ancients—forerunners to the Templar Order—who desire peace through the forced imposition of order.</p>
            <p>Origins received positive reviews from critics, who praised the story, characters, voice acting, reworked gameplay-systems, immersive world of Egypt and the visuals, while criticizing some of the pacing and technical issues. The game has been lauded as either the best or one of the best installments in the series by multiple critics.</p>
            <p>Ubisoft's decision to give the Assassin's Creed brand a year hiatus paid off big time. Origins is the best game in the series, period. Set in classical Egypt, Origins tells the origin story of the Assassins and Templar, and does so by tossing out everything we'd come to expect out of the series, overhauling virtually every system in the process. It's a really wonderful, creative game in a franchise that had grown stale.</p>
